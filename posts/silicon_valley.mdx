Silicon Valley is a great show.

```python
def test():
    return "Hello, World!"

print(test())
```

```rust
/// Doc comment.
struct Dummy {
    content: String,
}

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    // test
    let s: &'static str = "hello";
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
